/**
 * A [ResourceHandler] is a keel plugin that provides resource state monitoring and actuation capabilities
 * for a specific type of [Resource]. The primary tasks of a [ResourceHandler] are to:
 *
 * 1. Translate the declarative definition of a [Resource], as represented by the matching [ResourceSpec]
 *    (which can be arbitrarily abstract), into a concrete representation of the *desired state* of the resource
 *    that the plugin itself can interpret and act upon. This is implemented in the [desired] method.
 *
 * 2. Provide the *current state* of a [Resource] as it exists in the real world, using the same concrete
 *    representation as that used to represent desired state, so that keel can compare the two and look for
 *    a drift (a.k.a. diff) between desired and current state. This is implemented in the [current] method.
 *
 * 3. Act to resolve the drift when requested by keel. This is done via the [create], [update] and [delete]
 *    methods, which receive a [ResourceDiff] as a parameter.
 *
 *    a. A [ResourceHandler] whose [Resource] type supports [DeliveryArtifact] deployments is additionally
 *       responsible for notifying core Keel when new versions of those artifacts transition to a deploying
 *       state and to a successfully deployed state via the [notifyArtifactDeploying] and [notifyArtifactDeployed]
 *       methods, respectively.
 *
 * @param S the spec type.
 * @param R the resolved model type.
