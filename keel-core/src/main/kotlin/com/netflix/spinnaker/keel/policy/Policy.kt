/**
 * A Policy defines organizational- & team-level standards that all (matching) Intents must adhere to. If an Intent
 * does not meet the criteria defined by a Policy, it will not be scheduled for convergence. Even ad-hoc Intents that
 * will not be scheduled in the future will be submitted for compliance to Policies.
 *
 * Policies can also be used to define additional behavior, such as restricting when an Intent can be applied (e.g.
 * via execution windows). In these cases, it will be desired to allow an Intent to self-define the acceptable
 * windows to execute in. Policies can define a list of required Intent Attributes that must be set before the Policy
 * will be enacted.
 *
 * TODO rz - PolicySpec should only be available for operators to change. If the policy requires user-defined
 * configuration, those should be defined and supplied through Attributes. It is up to the Policy to determine
 * Attribute vs PolicySpec precedence on a per-usage basis.
