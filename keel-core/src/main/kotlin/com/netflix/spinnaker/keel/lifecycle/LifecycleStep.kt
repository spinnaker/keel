/**
 * Something that happens in the lifecycle of an artifact.
 * This step usually has a beginning, end, and transitions through statuses.
 *
 * Events are identified by the artifact, version, scope, type, and id.
 * We create an id for the artifact by calling [artifact.toLifecycleEventId()].
 *
 * [scope] and [type] control where the event is shown,
 *  right now there is only one of each.
 * [id] is a caller-provided id which will be used to uniquely identify a step.
 * [link] stores a link that will be surfaced in a clickable button.
 * [text] is the text for the even that is shown to the user.
