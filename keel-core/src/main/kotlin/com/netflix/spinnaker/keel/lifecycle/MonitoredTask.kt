 * Represents something that will be monitored.

 * Notes:
 *   This does not have to be an orca task.
 *   The "link" needs to be understandable by the monitor that will
 *     check it, it doesn't have to be a fully formed link.
 *
 * This 'task' is kicked off by a lifecycle event.
 * Events are emitted as the task is monitored based on that
 * initial event
